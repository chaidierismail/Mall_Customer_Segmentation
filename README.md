# Mall_Customer_Segmentation
Unsupervised learning to clustering customers

In this note book, I made an unsupervised learning to clustering mall customers. I used KMeans algorithm and
the elbow method to determine the best value of clusters. At the end of the notebook, I added some business action
based on the clustering to imporve the Mall's revenue.
